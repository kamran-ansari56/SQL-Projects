## Background

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.
Danny’s Diner needs your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some fundamental data from its few months of operation. Still, it has no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

### Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally, he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!
